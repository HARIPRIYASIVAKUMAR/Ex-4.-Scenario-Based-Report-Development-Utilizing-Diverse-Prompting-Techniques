# Ex-4.-Scenario-Based-Report-Development-Utilizing-Diverse-Prompting-Techniques
Objective: The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation.
## Aim: 
The aim is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot capable of handling customer inquiries such as product availability, order tracking, return/refund policies, and troubleshooting. By experimenting with diverse prompting strategies, the project seeks to identify the most effective methods that deliver accurate, engaging, and human-like customer support in a retail environment.
## Algorithm: 
## Step 1: Identify Use Cases

Select common retail customer support scenarios:

Product Inquiry

Socratic prompting

## Step 3: Design Prompts

Frame specific customer queries for each scenario.

Apply every prompting technique to the same query to compare outputs.

## Step 4: Execute Prompts

Use AI models (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, Meta AI) to generate responses for each prompt.

## Step 5: Collect Outputs

Document the chatbot responses produced by different prompting styles.

## Step 6: Analyze Responses

Evaluate responses based on:

Clarity (easy to understand)

Effectiveness (problem-solving ability)

## Step 7: Compare Techniques

Highlight strengths and weaknesses of each prompting method in various retail situations.

## Step 8: Conclude

Identify the most effective combination of prompting strategies (e.g., few-shot for accuracy, role-based for empathy, chain-of-thought for troubleshooting).

Recommend a hybrid approach for building a customer-centric retail chatbot.
## Prompt , Output & Result
## Scenario 1: Product Availability

Customer Query: “Do you have Nike running shoes in size 9?”

## (a) Zero-shot Prompting
Prompt: “Provide an answer to the customer’s query about product availability.”
Output: “Nike running shoes are available in multiple sizes. Availability for size 9 depends on current stock levels. You may check our website or share your location so I can confirm more accurately.”
Result: Generic but functional. Provides a safe answer, though it lacks personalization and precise confirmation.

## (b) One-shot Prompting
Prompt: “Example: If a customer asks about the availability of iPhone 14, respond: ‘Yes, it is available. Would you like it delivered or picked up in-store?’ Now answer this: Do you have Nike running shoes in size 9?”
Output: “Yes, Nike running shoes in size 9 are available. Would you like delivery or store pickup?”
Result: Customer-friendly and clear, but assumes stock without verification.

## (c) Few-shot Prompting
Prompt:
Q: “Do you have Samsung Galaxy S23?”
A: “Yes, it’s available. Would you like me to help with the purchase?”
Q: “Do you have Levi’s jeans in size 32?”
A: “Yes, size 32 is available. Do you prefer home delivery or pickup?”
Q: “Do you have Nike running shoes in size 9?”
Output: “Yes, Nike running shoes in size 9 are available. Should I add them to your cart?”
Result: Polished, natural, and subtly sales-oriented.

## (d) Role-based Prompting
Prompt: “You are a polite retail associate. Provide a helpful and engaging response: Do you have Nike running shoes in size 9?”
Output: “Absolutely! Let me check that for you. Yes, we have Nike running shoes in size 9. Would you like me to show you the available colors and styles?”
Result: Personalized and friendly, creating a positive customer experience.

## Scenario 2: Order Tracking

Customer Query: “Where is my order #12345?”

## (a) Zero-shot Prompting
Prompt: “Give the customer an update about their order status.”
Output: “Your order #12345 is currently being processed and will be shipped shortly.”
Result: Basic and informative, but lacks specific shipment details.

## (b) Few-shot Prompting
Prompt:
Q: “Where is my order #98765?”
A: “Your order #98765 is shipped and will arrive in 2 days.”
Q: “Where is my order #12345?”
Output: “Your order #12345 has been shipped and will be delivered by tomorrow evening.”
Result: More accurate and reassuring, showing clear timelines.

## (c) Role-based Prompting
Prompt: “You are a supportive customer service agent. Provide an empathetic update: Where is my order #12345?”
Output: “I understand you’d like an update on your order. Order #12345 has been dispatched and is expected to reach you tomorrow. Thank you for your patience!”
Result: Adds empathy and reassurance, building trust.

## Scenario 3: Return and Refund Policy

Customer Query: “Can I return a product if I don’t like it?”

## (a) Instruction-based Prompting
Prompt: “Explain the return policy in two clear sentences.”
Output: “Yes, products can be returned within 30 days of purchase. Please make sure the item is unused and packed in its original box.”
Result: Simple, direct, and easy to understand.

## (b) Socratic Prompting
Prompt: “Guide the customer with questions to check if they are eligible for return.”
Output: “Was the item purchased within the last 30 days? Is it unused and in its original packaging? If yes, then you are eligible for a return.”
Result: Interactive, though some customers may find it less convenient than a direct answer.

## Scenario 4: Troubleshooting

Customer Query: “My coffee maker is not working. What should I do?”

## (a) Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Prompt: “Think step by step and guide the customer through troubleshooting the coffee maker.”
Output: “First, confirm the power cord is connected. Next, check if the water tank is filled. Ensure the filter is placed correctly. If it still doesn’t function, please reach out to support for further help.”
Result: Logical and structured; excellent for technical guidance.

## (b) Persona-driven Prompting
Prompt: “Act as a friendly technical assistant and help the customer troubleshoot.”
Output: “Let’s solve this together! Please check if the power cord is plugged in securely. Also, confirm the water tank is filled and the filter is in position. If it still doesn’t brew, don’t worry—our support team can assist you further.”
Result: Balances friendliness with technical clarity, making the process less stressful.

## Analysis of Results

Zero-shot prompting: Provides safe, functional answers but lacks detail and personalization.

One-shot & few-shot prompting: Learns from examples and produces refined, customer-friendly outputs.

Role-based & persona-driven prompting: Adds empathy and human-like warmth, improving customer engagement.

Chain-of-thought prompting: Strong for systematic problem-solving.

Instruction-based prompting: Best for concise explanations such as return/refund policies.

Socratic prompting: Encourages self-assessment but can feel indirect.

## Conclusion

The most effective chatbot in a retail environment should integrate:

Few-shot prompting for accuracy and context,

Role-based prompting for empathy and engagement,

Chain-of-thought prompting for structured troubleshooting.

By blending these methods, the chatbot becomes not only informative but also customer-friendly, reliable, and human-like—significantly enhancing the overall retail experience.
